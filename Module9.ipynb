        "# Module 9: Full-Stack Integration, State Management & Web Security\n",
        "\n",
        "### Objectives\n",
        "- Integrate frontend and backend systems seamlessly.\n",
        "- Understand client/server communication models.\n",
        "- Learn about state management in single-page apps.\n",
        "- Apply essential security practices in full-stack applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Full-Stack Integration\n",
        "\n",
        "A web app is not just a UI or a backend server—it's the synergy of both. In full-stack development, the frontend (React, Vue, etc.) communicates with the backend (Node.js, Django, etc.) through APIs. These APIs are the glue that binds both layers.\n",
        "\n",
        "**RESTful APIs**: Most common architecture style for web apps. Endpoints typically follow a noun-based convention:\n",
        "\n",
        "```http\n",
        "GET /api/users → Get all users\n",
        "POST /api/users → Create a user\n",
        "GET /api/users/:id → Get one user\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**GraphQL** is another approach where the client defines the shape of the data returned. Ideal for optimizing payloads.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Middleware Integration**: When building scalable backends, middleware helps manage CORS, cookies, authentication, and error handling.\n",
        "\n",
        "```javascript\n",
        "app.use(cors());\n",
        "app.use(express.json());\n",
        "app.use('/api', router);\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### State Management\n",
        "\n",
        "As apps grow in complexity, managing the state becomes harder. State is everything your app knows at a given point—user info, shopping cart, active view, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Local State**: Stored in component memory (e.g. `useState` in React).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Global State**: Shared across multiple components. Libraries:\n",
        "- **Redux**: Predictable state container.\n",
        "- **Context API**: Built-in React tool for lightweight state management.\n",
        "- **Zustand, Recoil, MobX**: Simpler or more scalable alternatives.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Persistent State**: Stored across sessions.\n",
        "- `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` on the client.\n",
        "- JWT tokens or sessions on the server.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Web Security Fundamentals\n",
        "Security is not optional. Real-world engineering requires an understanding of the most common vulnerabilities and how to prevent them.\n",
        "\n",
        "**OWASP Top 5 You Must Know**:\n",
        "1. **Injection (SQL, NoSQL, Command)** – Always sanitize user input.\n",
        "2. **Broken Authentication** – Use robust libraries like Passport.js, bcrypt for password hashing.\n",
        "3. **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)** – Escape output on the frontend. Use CSP headers.\n",
        "4. **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)** – Use anti-CSRF tokens.\n",
        "5. **Insecure Deserialization** – Validate and sanitize JSON inputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Security Headers** (Helmet for Express):\n",
        "```javascript\n",
        "const helmet = require('helmet');\n",
        "app.use(helmet());\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Environment Variables** (Protect API keys):\n",
        "```bash\n",
        "touch .env\n",
        "```\n",
        "```env\n",
        "DB_PASSWORD=supersecret\n",
        "```\n",
        "```javascript\n",
        "require('dotenv').config();\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Practical Integration\n",
        "- Use React to make authenticated API calls to Node.js server.\n",
        "- Store JWT in cookies or localStorage securely.\n",
        "- Protect routes both client-side (with guards) and server-side (with middleware).\n",
        "- Deploy with HTTPS, avoid mixed content issues.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary\n",
        "Full-stack integration goes beyond connecting buttons to servers. It involves secure, state-aware, well-structured pipelines from frontend interaction to backend processing and data persistence. As you master these, you prepare yourself for real-world engineering teams that expect security, efficiency, and reliability from every component. Next: your final Capstone Project to apply all these skills."

        "# Module 3: HTML5 \n",
        "\n",
        "### Objectives\n",
        "- Understand the complete structure of HTML5 documents.\n",
        "- Learn semantic HTML tags and their impact on accessibility.\n",
        "- Apply modern HTML patterns to real-world page layouts.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Lecture\n",
        "\n",
        "HyperText Markup Language (HTML) remains the skeleton of the web. In this module, we go beyond the basics to understand **HTML5** as it stands today in the context of engineering-level application. While earlier versions of HTML focused on presentation and layout (often inappropriately), HTML5 is built with semantics, accessibility, and extensibility in mind.\n",
        "\n",
        "HTML documents start with the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration, followed by the `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` sections. The head tag contains meta-information: page title, character encoding (`<meta charset=\"UTF-8\">`), viewport settings for responsive design, and any external resources like stylesheets or JavaScript files. \n",
        "\n",
        "### Semantic Tags\n",
        "One of HTML5’s greatest contributions is **semantic tags**. Instead of misusing `<div>` and `<span>` for everything, we now structure pages with meaning:\n",
        "- `<header>`: introductory content or navigation.\n",
        "- `<nav>`: major navigational links.\n",
        "- `<main>`: the central content block of a document.\n",
        "- `<section>`: logical sections of content.\n",
        "- `<article>`: standalone content (like blog posts).\n",
        "- `<aside>`: supplementary content such as sidebars.\n",
        "- `<footer>`: closing remarks, metadata, or navigation.\n",
        "\n",
        "These semantic tags aid **screen readers** and assistive technologies by telling them what each part of the document means, which improves **accessibility (a11y)**. It also benefits SEO engines which now better understand content structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Forms and Inputs\n",
        "HTML5 also modernized form inputs. Previously we had only text fields, checkboxes, and radios. But HTML5 introduces new types:\n",
        "- `<input type=\"email\">`, `<input type=\"url\">` for format validation.\n",
        "- `<input type=\"date\">`, `<input type=\"time\">`, `<input type=\"range\">`.\n",
        "- The `<datalist>` tag allows suggestion boxes.\n",
        "- Native form validation using the `required`, `min`, `max`, `pattern` attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Engineering-level HTML involves building forms that are accessible, validated both client- and server-side, and well-structured for easy CSS styling. Inputs should always have labels for accessibility, either explicitly (`<label for=\"id\">`) or implicitly (wrapping the input).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Media Elements\n",
        "HTML5 introduces powerful media tags:\n",
        "- `<video>` with attributes like `controls`, `autoplay`, `loop`, `muted`, and `<source>` tags.\n",
        "- `<audio>` tag for background sounds or podcasts.\n",
        "- `<canvas>` and `<svg>` allow rendering dynamic 2D graphics and vector illustrations, often used in games or dashboards.\n",
        "\n",
        "These tags offload much of the work previously done by JavaScript libraries or plugins like Flash.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Accessibility Best Practices\n",
        "Web engineers are responsible for building **inclusive** applications. Consider using:\n",
        "- ARIA roles and attributes (`aria-label`, `aria-hidden`, etc.).\n",
        "- Logical heading order (`<h1>` to `<h6>`).\n",
        "- Descriptive alt text for images.\n",
        "- Keyboard navigability and focus indicators.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Practical Example\n",
        "```html\n",
        "<article>\n",
        "  <header>\n",
        "    <h1>Intro to Modern HTML5</h1>\n",
        "    <p>Published on <time datetime=\"2025-07-01\">July 1, 2025</time></p>\n",
        "  </header>\n",
        "  <section>\n",
        "    <p>HTML5 simplifies markup and enhances accessibility...</p>\n",
        "  </section>\n",
        "</article>\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, the `article` tag defines a self-contained blog post. Semantic tags define clear roles for screen readers and other tools.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary\n",
        "HTML5 is not just a markup language—it's the semantic backbone of modern web engineering. Mastering its features means your websites will not only function well but also serve everyone effectively."

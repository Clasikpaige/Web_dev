        "# Module 8: Databases – SQL and NoSQL\n",
        "\n",
        "### Objectives\n",
        "- Understand database theory and structure (relational vs non-relational).\n",
        "- Learn how to connect your backend to SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
        "- Understand schema design, CRUD operations, indexing, and performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Lecture\n",
        "\n",
        "Data is the heart of every modern web application. Whether you're building a blogging platform, an e-commerce app, or a social media system, you must decide how data will be stored, accessed, and maintained. Databases serve this purpose.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are two primary database paradigms:\n",
        "- **SQL (Relational Databases)** – Tables, rows, schemas, and relationships.\n",
        "- **NoSQL (Non-relational Databases)** – Collections, documents, key-value pairs.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Relational Databases – SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL)\n",
        "\n",
        "These databases are based on the relational model, with data organized into rows and tables. They're ideal when your data is structured and needs relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: A users table and a posts table, where each post belongs to a user.\n",
        "\n",
        "SQL example using PostgreSQL:\n",
        "```sql\n",
        "CREATE TABLE users (\n",
        "  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n",
        "  username VARCHAR(50),\n",
        "  email VARCHAR(100)\n",
        ");\n",
        "\n",
        "CREATE TABLE posts (\n",
        "  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n",
        "  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),\n",
        "  title TEXT,\n",
        "  content TEXT\n",
        ");\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Query to get posts by a user:\n",
        "```sql\n",
        "SELECT posts.title FROM posts\n",
        "JOIN users ON posts.user_id = users.id\n",
        "WHERE users.username = 'john_doe';\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Libraries to connect in Node.js:\n",
        "```bash\n",
        "npm install pg\n",
        "```\n",
        "```javascript\n",
        "const { Pool } = require('pg');\n",
        "const pool = new Pool({ connectionString: 'postgres://user:pass@localhost/dbname' });\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### NoSQL Databases – MongoDB\n",
        "NoSQL databases like MongoDB store data in JSON-like documents (BSON format). It is flexible, schema-less, and great for nested or rapidly evolving data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Document example:\n",
        "```json\n",
        "{\n",
        "  \"username\": \"jane_doe\",\n",
        "  \"posts\": [\n",
        "    { \"title\": \"Hello\", \"content\": \"World\" }\n",
        "  ]\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Install and connect MongoDB in Node:\n",
        "```bash\n",
        "npm install mongoose\n",
        "```\n",
        "```javascript\n",
        "const mongoose = require('mongoose');\n",
        "mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/myapp');\n",
        "\n",
        "const User = mongoose.model('User', new mongoose.Schema({\n",
        "  username: String,\n",
        "  email: String\n",
        "}));\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### When to Choose What\n",
        "- Use **SQL** when data relationships, integrity, and transactions are important.\n",
        "- Use **NoSQL** when you need scalability, flexibility, and quick iteration.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Indexing and Query Optimization\n",
        "- Always index fields that are queried often.\n",
        "- Use EXPLAIN in SQL to check query plans.\n",
        "- In MongoDB, `db.collection.createIndex({ field: 1 })` improves performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary\n",
        "Database choice is architectural. SQL gives structure and relational guarantees, while NoSQL offers speed and scalability. Understanding both helps you become a flexible full-stack engineer. Mastering CRUD operations, query languages (SQL, Mongoose), and indexing prepares you for real-world engineering challenges. In the next module, we’ll merge frontend and backend systems into a unified application."

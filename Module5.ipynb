        "# Module 5: JavaScript Essentials and DOM Manipulation\n",
        "\n",
        "### Objectives\n",
        "- Understand JavaScript syntax and dynamic typing.\n",
        "- Learn DOM traversal and manipulation techniques.\n",
        "- Understand events, functions, and interactivity.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Lecture\n",
        "\n",
        "JavaScript (JS) is the essential programming language of the web, powering dynamic behavior and user interaction. From event handling to manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM), JavaScript is how engineers build responsive, interactive web applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "### JavaScript Basics\n",
        "JavaScript is dynamically typed and loosely structured. A few fundamental concepts include:\n",
        "- Variables declared using `let`, `const`, or `var` (avoid `var` in modern code).\n",
        "- Primitive types: `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `null`, `undefined`, `symbol`.\n",
        "- Arrays and objects for composite data.\n",
        "- Control structures: `if`, `while`, `for`, `switch`, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "```js\n",
        "let name = \"Alice\";\n",
        "const age = 24;\n",
        "let user = { name: \"Alice\", age: 24 };\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Functions in JS are first-class citizens. You can define them in multiple ways:\n",
        "```js\n",
        "function greet() { return \"Hello\"; }\n",
        "const add = (a, b) => a + b;\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Document Object Model (DOM)\n",
        "DOM is the in-memory tree structure of the HTML document. Each HTML element is a node, and JavaScript can manipulate these nodes to change the document dynamically.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Selecting Elements\n",
        "```js\n",
        "let title = document.getElementById(\"main-title\");\n",
        "let paragraphs = document.querySelectorAll(\"p\");\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Changing Content and Styles\n",
        "```js\n",
        "title.textContent = \"Welcome to My Site\";\n",
        "title.style.color = \"blue\";\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Creating and Appending Elements\n",
        "```js\n",
        "let newPara = document.createElement(\"p\");\n",
        "newPara.textContent = \"New paragraph added dynamically!\";\n",
        "document.body.appendChild(newPara);\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Events and Listeners\n",
        "Events are how users interact with a page—clicks, keypresses, scrolls, etc. Add listeners to elements like this:\n",
        "```js\n",
        "document.getElementById(\"submit\").addEventListener(\"click\", function() {\n",
        "  alert(\"Form submitted!\");\n",
        "});\n",
        "```\n",
        "You can also detach events using `removeEventListener`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Best Practices\n",
        "- Keep logic modular: use functions and avoid global scope pollution.\n",
        "- Use `const` for values that don’t change, `let` for block-scoped mutable data.\n",
        "- Prefer modern syntax (`=>`, `template literals`, `for...of`, etc.).\n",
        "- Avoid directly manipulating DOM excessively—use it wisely.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary\n",
        "JavaScript is the engine that brings HTML and CSS to life. Its power lies in its flexibility and real-time interaction with the DOM. A solid understanding of DOM traversal, event handling, and ES6+ syntax sets the foundation for more advanced topics like asynchronous programming, frameworks, and full-stack development."

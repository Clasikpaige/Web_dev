        "# Module 4: CSS Fundamentals and Responsive Design\n",
        "\n",
        "### Objectives\n",
        "- Understand CSS selectors, properties, and cascading rules.\n",
        "- Learn how to style layouts using Flexbox and Grid.\n",
        "- Apply responsive design using media queries and fluid layouts.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Lecture\n",
        "\n",
        "Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is the design language of the web. It separates content from presentation, allowing developers to style and layout HTML documents precisely. In this module, we take a foundational yet comprehensive look at how CSS works and how modern developers engineer responsive, beautiful designs.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Selectors and Rules\n",
        "A CSS rule has a selector and a declaration block:\n",
        "```css\n",
        "h1 {\n",
        "  color: navy;\n",
        "  font-size: 2rem;\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "Selectors identify the elements, while declarations define how they appear. Advanced selectors include:\n",
        "- `.class`, `#id`, `element element` (descendant), `element > element` (child)\n",
        "- Pseudo-classes like `:hover`, `:first-child`\n",
        "- Attribute selectors: `input[type=\"text\"]`\n",
        "\n",
        "### Cascading and Specificity\n",
        "CSS follows the **Cascading** principle: rules closer to the element or more specific override others. Specificity ranks as follows:\n",
        "1. Inline styles (most specific)\n",
        "2. ID selectors\n",
        "3. Class selectors\n",
        "4. Type selectors\n",
        "\n",
        "Avoid using `!important` unless absolutely necessary—it overrides the cascade and makes styles harder to debug.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Layout Systems\n",
        "**Flexbox** and **CSS Grid** are the two core layout models:\n",
        "- Flexbox is 1-dimensional (row or column). Use it for aligning elements in one direction.\n",
        "- Grid is 2-dimensional. Use it for full-page layouts and complex grids.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example using Flexbox:**\n",
        "```css\n",
        ".container {\n",
        "  display: flex;\n",
        "  justify-content: space-between;\n",
        "  align-items: center;\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example using Grid:**\n",
        "```css\n",
        ".grid-layout {\n",
        "  display: grid;\n",
        "  grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr 1fr;\n",
        "  gap: 1rem;\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Responsive Design\n",
        "A modern web page must adjust to screen sizes from mobile phones to 4K monitors. This is where **media queries** come in:\n",
        "```css\n",
        "@media (max-width: 768px) {\n",
        "  .container {\n",
        "    flex-direction: column;\n",
        "  }\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "Also important are **fluid units** like `%`, `em`, `rem`, `vh`, and `vw`, which scale content based on screen or font size.\n",
        "\n",
        "Use of the `viewport` meta tag in HTML ensures proper rendering:\n",
        "```html\n",
        "<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Box Model\n",
        "Every HTML element is a box with:\n",
        "- Content → Padding → Border → Margin\n",
        "Misunderstanding the box model causes layout bugs. Always set:\n",
        "```css\n",
        "* {\n",
        "  box-sizing: border-box;\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary\n",
        "CSS is not just about colors and fonts—it's a complete layout and interface language. Mastery of Flexbox, Grid, media queries, and the box model makes the difference between amateur and professional interfaces."

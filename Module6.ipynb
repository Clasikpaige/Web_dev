        "# Module 6: Git, Version Control, and Engineering Collaboration\n",
        "\n",
        "### Objectives\n",
        "- Understand the purpose of version control systems (VCS).\n",
        "- Learn core Git commands and workflow.\n",
        "- Apply GitHub for collaboration and code reviews.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Lecture\n",
        "\n",
        "Version control systems are essential to software engineering. They track code changes, enable team collaboration, and preserve the history of your projects. Git is the industry standard for distributed version control, and GitHub is the most common platform for hosting Git repositories.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why Use Version Control?\n",
        "Without version control, teams risk overwriting each otherâ€™s work and losing progress. Version control:\n",
        "- Keeps a complete history of your codebase.\n",
        "- Allows branching and merging for parallel development.\n",
        "- Enables code review and quality control processes.\n",
        "- Facilitates collaboration between developers, testers, and designers.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Git Basics\n",
        "Git operates on your local machine and synchronizes with remote repositories. Key commands include:\n",
        "\n",
        "```bash\n",
        "git init               # initialize repo\n",
        "git clone <url>        # download a repo\n",
        "git status             # check current state\n",
        "git add <file>         # stage a file\n",
        "git commit -m \"msg\"    # commit changes\n",
        "git push               # upload to remote repo\n",
        "git pull               # download latest changes\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Git Branching Model\n",
        "Branching allows multiple streams of development:\n",
        "- `main` or `master`: the production-ready code.\n",
        "- `feature/xyz`: individual developer branches.\n",
        "- `dev`: used for integration/testing before merging to `main`.\n",
        "\n",
        "```bash\n",
        "git checkout -b feature/login-page\n",
        "# work on feature\n",
        "git commit -am \"Add login form markup\"\n",
        "git checkout main\n",
        "git merge feature/login-page\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Collaborating with GitHub\n",
        "GitHub enhances Git with a web interface, issue tracking, pull requests, and CI/CD integrations.\n",
        "- Fork projects and open pull requests.\n",
        "- Use issues for bugs or features.\n",
        "- Enable Actions for automated testing.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Git Ignore and Best Practices\n",
        "- Use `.gitignore` to exclude files (e.g., `node_modules`, `.env`).\n",
        "- Write clear, descriptive commit messages.\n",
        "- Push often, pull frequently to stay in sync.\n",
        "- Use branches for features and bug fixes.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary\n",
        "Git is a vital tool for every web developer. It supports code reliability, teamwork, experimentation, and rollback. Understanding Git lays the foundation for CI/CD pipelines, collaborative engineering teams, and real-world software lifecycle workflows."

    "# Module 1: Introduction to the Web and Internet Fundamentals\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the first module of our full-stack web development course. This course is designed for beginners, but it will go deep into real-world, engineering-grade concepts. In this module, we‚Äôll demystify what the web is, how the internet works, and why understanding the fundamentals is critical for every developer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üåê What Is the Web?\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"Web\" refers to the **World Wide Web (WWW)** ‚Äî a system of interlinked hypertext documents accessed via the internet. The internet, however, is the **physical network** of computers (via routers, switches, and cables) that makes the web possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The web runs primarily on **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)** ‚Äî a request-response protocol that powers web communication. Every time you type a URL into a browser, an HTTP request is made to retrieve a resource (like a webpage).\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚öôÔ∏è How the Web Works (Step by Step)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **DNS Resolution**: You type `www.example.com`. Your browser uses the DNS system to find the IP address (e.g. `93.184.216.34`).\n",
    "2. **TCP/IP Connection**: A TCP connection is initiated using IP addresses to reach the server.\n",
    "3. **HTTP Request**: A GET request is sent over the connection to request a specific web resource.\n",
    "4. **Server Response**: The server sends back an HTML page.\n",
    "5. **Rendering**: The browser renders the HTML, fetches CSS, JavaScript, images, and displays the final web page.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîê Protocols and Port Numbers\n",
    "- HTTP: Port 80\n",
    "- HTTPS: Port 443 (encrypted using TLS)\n",
    "- FTP: Port 21 (used for transferring files)\n",
    "- SSH: Port 22 (remote secure shell login)\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding protocols allows you to build more secure and performant apps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üß† Client vs Server\n",
    "- **Client**: Your browser (Chrome, Safari). Sends requests and displays results.\n",
    "- **Server**: Responds to client requests (Apache, NGINX, Node.js).\n",
    "\n",
    "### üì¶ Request Lifecycle Example\n",
    "Imagine you visit `www.reddit.com`. Here's what happens:\n",
    "- Your browser connects to Reddit‚Äôs server.\n",
    "- It sends a GET request for `/`.\n",
    "- Reddit responds with HTML, which includes links to CSS/JS/images.\n",
    "- The browser renders it, applying styles and loading scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üì° What Happens Under the Hood\n",
    "When you load a page:\n",
    "- DNS lookup (resolves name to IP)\n",
    "- Browser cache check (is it already downloaded?)\n",
    "- TLS handshake if HTTPS\n",
    "- HTTP request made\n",
    "- Server processes it\n",
    "- Response sent, headers + body\n",
    "- Browser parses, renders DOM, runs scripts\n",
    "\n",
    "### üåç Why This Matters\n",
    "Understanding this foundational model helps you:\n",
    "- Debug why a website is slow\n",
    "- Understand REST APIs and full-stack flow\n",
    "- Secure your apps\n",
    "- Know where errors are coming from (DNS, SSL, server, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "**Homework**:\n",
    "- Use `ping`, `traceroute`, and `nslookup` to explore DNS resolution.\n",
    "- Inspect an HTTP request using Chrome DevTools ‚Üí Network tab.\n",
    "\n",

    "# Module 2: How Browsers Work & Introduction to HTML\n",
    "\n",
    "In this module, we‚Äôll understand how a browser interprets code, how HTML defines page structure, and what happens from HTML input to visual rendering.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üß† What Is a Browser Engine?\n",
    "A browser engine is the software component responsible for:\n",
    "- Parsing HTML/CSS\n",
    "- Laying out elements on screen\n",
    "- Handling JavaScript execution\n",
    "\n",
    "**Major engines include:**\n",
    "- Blink (Chrome, Opera)\n",
    "- WebKit (Safari)\n",
    "- Gecko (Firefox)\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚öôÔ∏è Rendering Pipeline\n",
    "1. **HTML Tokenization** ‚Üí DOM Tree\n",
    "2. **CSS Parsing** ‚Üí CSSOM Tree\n",
    "3. **DOM + CSSOM** ‚Üí Render Tree\n",
    "4. **Layout** ‚Üí Elements get positions/sizes\n",
    "5. **Painting** ‚Üí Drawing pixels\n",
    "6. **Compositing** ‚Üí Layers combined to screen\n",
    "\n",
    "### üß± Introduction to HTML\n",
    "**HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** is the backbone of any webpage. It defines content structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Basic Tags:**\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<!DOCTYPE html>\n",
    "<html>\n",
    "  <head>\n",
    "    <title>My Page</title>\n",

    "- `<h1>` to `<h6>`: Headings\n",
    "- `<p>`: Paragraph\n",
    "- `<img src=\"\">`: Images\n",
    "- `<a href=\"\">`: Links\n",
    "- `<div>`: Division (container)\n",
    "- `<span>`: Inline container\n",
    "- `<form>`: Input handling\n",
    "\n",
    "### üß≠ Semantic HTML\n",
    "Semantic elements convey meaning:\n",
    "- `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<main>`, `<nav>` improve accessibility and SEO.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üß™ Developer Tools\n",
    "Inspect live web pages using Chrome DevTools:\n",
    "- Right-click ‚Üí Inspect\n",
    "- See DOM in real time\n",
    "- Modify and test HTML/CSS live\n",
    "\n",
    "### üß† Accessibility & Structure\n",
    "Use correct HTML structure for:\n",
    "- Screen readers (aria-labels, roles)\n",
    "- SEO (search engines rely on heading tags)\n",
    "- Responsive design (semantic containers adapt better)\n",
    "\n",

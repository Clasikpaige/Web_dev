    "# Module 1: Introduction to the Web and Internet Fundamentals\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "Welcome to Module 1 of our Web Development Engineering course. In this module, we’ll lay the foundation for the rest of the course by demystifying what the internet and the web actually are. While many people casually use terms like “web,” “internet,” and “HTTP,” very few understand what’s actually happening under the hood. As an engineering student or aspiring web developer, you’ll not only build websites but also understand the technical infrastructure that powers them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Internet vs. The Web\n",
    "Let’s clear up a common misconception: the **internet** and the **web** are not the same thing. The internet is a vast network of interconnected devices—computers, phones, routers, etc.—that use standardized communication protocols. The **Web** (short for World Wide Web) is an application layer on top of the internet that uses **HTTP** to transfer hypertext documents. Other services like email, file transfers, and video calls also run on the internet but are not part of the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Components\n",
    "### IP Addresses\n",
    "Every device connected to the internet has a unique IP (Internet Protocol) address. IP addresses come in IPv4 and IPv6 formats. These addresses are used to locate devices on the network, similar to how a home address identifies a physical location.\n",
    "\n",
    "### DNS – Domain Name System\n",
    "Humans remember domain names like `google.com`, but machines talk via IP addresses. DNS is the system that translates domain names into IP addresses. When you type a URL into your browser, it queries a DNS server to find the matching IP.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Routers & Packets\n",
    "Data on the internet is broken into small packets. These packets travel independently through various routers to reach their destination. Once all packets arrive, they are reassembled into the original message (like a webpage).\n",
    "\n",
    "## HTTP and HTTPS\n",
    "**HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)** is the foundation of data communication on the web. It defines how clients (browsers) request resources and how servers respond. \n",
    "\n",
    "Typical structure of an HTTP request:\n",
    "- Method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)\n",
    "- URL (Uniform Resource Locator)\n",
    "- Headers (metadata like content type)\n",
    "- Body (data sent to the server, e.g., in a form submission)\n",
    "\n",
    "### HTTPS adds Security\n",
    "**HTTPS** (HTTP Secure) encrypts the data using TLS/SSL protocols. This prevents eavesdropping and is mandatory for most modern sites.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Web Clients and Servers\n",
    "- A **client** is usually a web browser or mobile app.\n",
    "- A **server** is a remote machine that stores and serves web content.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you enter a URL:\n",
    "1. Your browser (client) makes a DNS request.\n",
    "2. The browser initiates an HTTP or HTTPS request to the server.\n",
    "3. The server responds with HTML/CSS/JavaScript files.\n",
    "4. Your browser renders those files into a visible webpage.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Web Hosting and Deployment Concepts\n",
    "- **Shared Hosting:** Multiple websites on one server.\n",
    "- **VPS:** Virtual private servers offer more control.\n",
    "- **Cloud Hosting:** Elastic infrastructure like AWS or Vercel.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "By the end of this module, you should understand:\n",
    "- The difference between the internet and web.\n",
    "- The role of IP addresses, DNS, and routers.\n",
    "- How HTTP/HTTPS facilitate communication.\n",
    "- Basic client-server architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next module, we’ll explore HTML and the structure of web documents."

    "# Module 2: HTML — The Structure of the Web\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is HTML?\n",
    "**HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** is the standard language for creating webpages. It gives structure to your content—like headings, paragraphs, images, and links—so that browsers know how to display them.\n",
    "\n",
    "HTML is not a programming language; it’s a markup language that tells the browser how to organize content.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Anatomy of an HTML Document\n",
    "Every HTML document follows a standard structure:\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<!DOCTYPE html>\n",
    "<html>\n",
    "  <head>\n",
    "    <title>My First Page</title>\n",
    "  </head>\n",
    "  <body>\n",
    "    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>\n",
    "    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>\n",
    "  </body>\n",
    "</html>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Elements and Tags\n",
    "- **Elements** define parts of a webpage (`<p>`, `<h1>`, `<img>`).\n",
    "- Tags usually come in pairs: an opening (`<p>`) and a closing (`</p>`).\n",
    "- Some tags are self-closing, like `<img>` and `<br>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common HTML Tags\n",
    "- `<h1>` to `<h6>`: Headings\n",
    "- `<p>`: Paragraph\n",
    "- `<a href=\"\">`: Hyperlinks\n",
    "- `<img src=\"\" alt=\"\">`: Images\n",
    "- `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`: Lists\n",
    "- `<div>` and `<span>`: Containers\n",
    "- `<form>`: For user input (forms)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Semantic HTML\n",
    "Semantic elements clearly describe their purpose, making HTML more accessible and SEO-friendly. Examples:\n",
    "- `<header>`: Page or section header\n",
    "- `<nav>`: Navigation links\n",
    "- `<main>`: Main content\n",
    "- `<footer>`: Footer\n",
    "- `<article>`, `<section>`: Standalone content blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "## Accessibility and ARIA\n",
    "Webpages should be accessible to users with disabilities. Semantic HTML helps screen readers interpret content. **ARIA** (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes enhance accessibility for complex widgets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Developer Tools\n",
    "Most browsers come with built-in DevTools (right-click → Inspect) to:\n",
    "- View page structure (Elements tab)\n",
    "- Debug HTML errors\n",
    "- Test responsiveness\n",
    "\n",
    "## HTML Best Practices\n",
    "- Always include `<!DOCTYPE html>` to ensure standards mode.\n",
    "- Use lowercase for tags and attributes.\n",
    "- Keep nesting logical and consistent.\n",
    "- Use semantic tags wherever possible.\n",
    "- Validate HTML using [validator.w3.org](https://validator.w3.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "In this module, you learned:\n",
    "- The structure and syntax of HTML\n",
    "- How to use basic and semantic tags\n",
    "- How accessibility and validation are part of web engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we’ll introduce CSS to style and format your web content."
